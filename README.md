# How Many Steps

This is an Alexa skill that tells you the number of steps there are between two cities or places. For example, you can ask Alexa to tell you you the number of steps between London and Paris by saying "Ask How Many Steps there are between London and Paris". Alternatively, you can just ask Alexa for a fact by saying "Tell me a fact", this will randomly tell you how many steps there are between two random states in the United States.

Current cities supported are in Europe and the United States.

According to this website, the average number of steps per KM is 1320 steps:
